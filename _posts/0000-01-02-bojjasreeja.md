## Introduction

HI my name is sreeja
## Getting Started

I began my programming journey in high school when I first encountered HTML and CSS. It fascinated me how I could create simple web pages and style them. As time passed, I explored different programming languages, but Python quickly became my favorite due to its simplicity and versatility.

## Learning Git

One of the most important tools I learned was Git. Understanding version control was crucial for managing my projects and collaborating with others. I started using Git for my personal projects and eventually for contributing to open-source projects.

## Conclusion

Programming has been an incredible journey filled with challenges and learning opportunities. I look forward to sharing more about my experiences and projects in future posts.

Thank you for reading!
